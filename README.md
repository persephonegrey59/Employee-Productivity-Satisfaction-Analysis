# INST414 - Employee Productivity & Satisfaction
Final project for INST414 - Analysis of employee productivity and job satisfaction.

This repository contains all files for my final project in INST414: Data Science Techniques.

## Project Overview

This project explores whether employee characteristics—such as gender, department, position, and tenure—are associated with differences in productivity and job satisfaction. The analysis uses a fictional but realistic HR dataset and applies multiple linear regression.

## Contents

- `INST414Sprint3.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with full data cleaning, encoding, modeling, and regression results.
- `employee_data_encoded.csv`: Cleaned and encoded dataset used in the final analysis.
- `INST414 - Sprint 3.pdf`: Final written report with literature integration and project discussion.

## Tools Used

- Python (pandas, statsmodels)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub

## Reproducing This Analysis
To replicate this project:
1. Clone the repository:
>  git clone https://github.com/persephonegrey59/INST414-Employee-Productivity.git
>  cd INST414-Employee-Productivity
2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
>  jupyter notebook INST414Sprint3.ipynb
3. Run all cells in order. The notebook will:
- Load the original dataset
- Calculate tenure from joining date
- Clean and encode variables
- Run two OLS regressions
- Print results for both productivity and satisfaction models

Requirements:
- Python 3.9+
- pandas
- statsmodels
- Jupyter Notebook
